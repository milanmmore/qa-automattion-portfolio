## üè∑Ô∏è Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- **master** - Production-ready code
- **develop** - Integration branch for features
- **feature/** - Individual feature development
- **hotfix/** - Critical bug fixes

### Example Branch Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/login-automation

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add Selenium login automation tests"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/login-automation

# Create pull request
# After review, merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/login-automation

# Deploy to staging
# After testing, merge to master
git checkout master
git merge develop
```

## üìã Git Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Meaningful Commit Messages
- **Good:** "Add Selenium login automation with error handling"
- **Bad:** "Fixed stuff"

### 2. Atomic Commits
- Each commit represents one logical change
- Easy to review and revert if needed

### 3. Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes
- `release/` - Release preparation

### 4. Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance
