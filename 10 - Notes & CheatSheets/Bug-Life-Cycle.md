## 📊 Bug Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Who Sets | Next Actions |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **New** | Bug reported, not yet reviewed | Reporter | Review and assign |
| **Assigned** | Bug assigned to developer | Lead/Manager | Start investigation |
| **In Progress** | Developer working on fix | Developer | Complete fix |
| **Fixed** | Code fix completed | Developer | Ready for testing |
| **Verified** | Fix confirmed by QA | QA Engineer | Ready to close |
| **Closed** | Bug resolved completely | QA Engineer | Archive |
| **Reopened** | Bug found again after fix | QA Engineer | Reassign to developer |
| **Deferred** | Postponed to future release | Lead/Manager | Revisit later |
| **Duplicate** | Same bug reported before | Lead/Manager | Link to original |
| **Not Reproducible** | Cannot reproduce the issue | Developer/QA | Gather more info |
| **Won't Fix** | Bug won't be fixed | Lead/Manager | Document reason |

## 🎯 Status Transition Rules

### Valid Transitions
```
New → Assigned, Duplicate, Not Reproducible, Won't Fix
Assigned → In Progress, Duplicate, Not Reproducible, Won't Fix
In Progress → Fixed, Duplicate, Not Reproducible, Won't Fix
Fixed → Verified, Reopened
Verified → Closed, Reopened
Closed → Reopened (rare)
Reopened → Assigned, In Progress
```

### Invalid Transitions
```
❌ New → Fixed (must be assigned first)
❌ Fixed → In Progress (already completed)
❌ Closed → In Progress (must reopen first)
❌ Assigned → Closed (must be fixed and verified)
```

- **Example:** Payment processing fails
- **SLA:** 1-2 weeks

### Minor
- **Impact:** Minor functionality issues
- **Priority:** Fix in next release
- **Example:** UI alignment issues
- **SLA:** 2-4 weeks

### Cosmetic
- **Impact:** Visual/UI issues only
- **Priority:** Fix when time permits
- **Example:** Spelling errors, color mismatches
- **SLA:** 1-2 months

## 🔄 Workflow Best Practices

### Bug Reporting Phase
1. **Verify the bug** - Reproduce multiple times
2. **Gather evidence** - Screenshots, logs, videos
3. **Check for duplicates** - Search existing bugs
4. **Write clear steps** - Anyone can reproduce
5. **Set appropriate severity** - Based on impact

### Bug Assignment Phase
1. **Review all new bugs** - Daily triage meeting
2. **Assign to appropriate developer** - Based on expertise
3. **Set realistic due dates** - Consider workload
4. **Communicate expectations** - Clear requirements

### Bug Development Phase
1. **Acknowledge assignment** - Confirm understanding
2. **Investigate thoroughly** - Root cause analysis
3. **Implement fix** - Follow coding standards
4. **Test locally** - Verify fix works
5. **Update status** - Move to "Fixed"

### Bug Verification Phase
1. **Test the fix** - Verify issue is resolved
2. **Regression testing** - Check related functionality
3. **Update status** - Move to "Verified" or "Reopened"
4. **Document results** - Add verification notes

## 📊 Bug Metrics & KPIs

### Key Metrics
```sql
-- Bug density (bugs per KLOC)
SELECT COUNT(*) / (SELECT SUM(lines_of_code) / 1000) as bug_density
FROM bugs WHERE status != 'Closed';

-- Bug resolution time
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(resolved_date, created_date)) as avg_resolution_days
FROM bugs WHERE status = 'Closed';

-- Bug leakage (bugs found in production)
SELECT COUNT(*) as production_bugs
FROM bugs WHERE environment = 'Production';
```

### Quality Metrics
- **Bug Detection Rate:** Bugs found per testing phase
- **Bug Fix Rate:** Percentage of bugs fixed on time
- **Bug Reopen Rate:** Percentage of bugs reopened
- **Customer Reported Bugs:** Bugs found by end users

## 🛠️ Tools & Automation

### Bug Tracking Tools
- **JIRA:** Most popular, comprehensive
- **Bugzilla:** Open source, feature-rich
- **GitHub Issues:** Simple, integrated with code
- **Azure DevOps:** Microsoft ecosystem
- **Linear:** Modern, fast interface

### Automation Integration
```python
# Example: Automated bug creation
def create_bug(title, description, severity, priority):
    bug_data = {
        'title': title,
        'description': description,
        'severity': severity,
        'priority': priority,
        'status': 'New',
        'reporter': 'Automated Test'
    }
    return jira.create_issue(bug_data)
```
